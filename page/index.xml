      <description>Cross-Platform frameworks: A comparative study Developed as a collaboration project between Intelygenz Software and the University of Cádiz.
The study aimed to dispel doubts when choosing a cross-platform development. For this, the most used cross-platform frameworks in the software development industry (React Native, Ionic, Flutter and Weex) have been compared in terms of execution times and code quality, offering an objective comparison between them. This comparison has been made through the development of four benchmark applications, one in each of the frameworks and the measurement of metrics in them for the subsequent contrast of the data obtained.</description>
